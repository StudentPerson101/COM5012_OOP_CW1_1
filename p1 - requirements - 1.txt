1) Functional requirements (Functions/Services)
A. User & access services
FR1 – Authentication: Users can log in with a username/password.
FR2 – Role-based access: The system restricts actions based on role (Member, Librarian, Administrator).
FR3 – View account info (Member): Members can view their current loans (what they have borrowed and due dates).

B. Catalogue / search services
FR4 – Search books: Members (and staff) can search by title and/or author.
FR5 – Availability display: Search results show current status: Available / Borrowed / Reserved.

C. Circulation services (borrow/return/reserve)
FR6 – Borrow book: A Member can borrow a book only if it is Available and the member is eligible.
FR7 – Borrowing limit enforcement: A Member can borrow up to 5 books at a time. Attempts beyond this are rejected with a clear message.
FR8 – Return book: A Member (or Librarian processing the return) can return a borrowed book and the system updates status accordingly.
FR9 – Reserve book: A Member can place a reservation only if the book is currently Borrowed (or otherwise not Available).
FR10 – Reservation expiry rule: A reservation expires if not collected/processed within 3 days (after it becomes ready for pickup / made available—implementation will define the trigger).
FR11 – Status tracking (automatic): The system automatically updates a book’s status after each action (Borrow/Return/Reserve/Expiry).

D. Librarian services
FR12 – Manage book records (CRUD): Librarians can add, update, and remove book records.
FR13 – Handle requests: Librarians can process borrowing, returns, and reservation handling (e.g., marking a reservation as collected/expired).

E. Administrator services
FR14 – Account management: Administrators can create/update/disable Member and Librarian accounts.
FR15 – Rule configuration: Administrators can set key rules (at minimum: max borrowed books, reservation expiry days; optionally loan period and late penalty rules).

F. Reporting / outputs
FR16 – Overdue report: Librarians can generate a simple list of overdue books (book + borrower + due date).
FR17 – Notifications (basic): The system can generate alerts for:
- due date approaching
- overdue items
- reservation available / reservation expired
(For a partial system this can be “in-app messages” or console output.)

2) Non-functional requirements (Quality attributes / constraints)
NFR1 – Performance: Core actions (search, borrow, return, reserve) should complete quickly (e.g., near-instant for typical class-size datasets).

NFR2 – Security:
Passwords must not be stored in plain text (use hashing).
Enforce role-based permissions for all privileged actions.

NFR3 – Data integrity & consistency:
A book cannot be borrowed by two members at once.
Status transitions must be valid (e.g., only “Borrowed” can be “Returned”).
Borrow limit (5) and reservation expiry (3 days) must always be enforced.

NFR4 – Reliability & error handling: The system must handle invalid inputs gracefully (unknown book ID, wrong credentials, trying to reserve an available book, etc.) without crashing.

NFR5 – Maintainability (OO design): Code should be modular and readable, demonstrating OO principles:

Encapsulation: internal state hidden behind methods (e.g., status changes only via methods).

Inheritance: shared “User” behaviour reused by Member/Librarian/Admin.

Polymorphism: role-specific behaviour via overridden methods or interfaces.

NFR6 – Usability: Clear prompts/messages; users can understand why an action failed (e.g., “limit reached”).

NFR7 – Auditability (recommended): Log key actions (borrow/return/reserve/admin changes) for troubleshooting.

NFR8 – Portability: Runs consistently on standard environments for the chosen language (e.g., Windows/macOS/Linux).

NFR9 – Testability: Core rules (borrow limit, expiry, status transitions) should be unit-testable.
